# ring.muhokama.fun

> **ring.muhokama.fun** is a [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring)

## Contribute to the generator

The Webring is a project that uses version 2 of
[YOCaml](https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml), a static site generator written in
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org), which is very flexible and fun.

The project is divided into five parts:
- `lib/` contains the library code used to describe the generator. This is where
  all the webring's logic is to be found. (The library is called `Gem` (_because
  I have a dubious sense of humour_)
- `bin/` contains the binary code used to generate the site. It can be invoked
  using the command `dune exec bin/ring.exe --help`. The binary simply invokes
  the logical pipelines described in `lib`.
- `data` contains the static data used to build the ring (participants,
  participant chain, etc.). This is generally the part that is important for
  adding or moderating participants in the ring.
- `static` contains the static elements (images, css, templates) used to build
  the HTML pages generated by the generator (for _front-end afficionados_).

### Setting up the development environment

To work, we assume that a version greater than or equal to `2.2.0~beta1` of
[OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org) is installed on your machine ([Install
OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html), [upgrade to version
`2.2.0~xxxx`](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-2-0-beta2/#Try-it)).

> [!TIP]  
> We're relying on version `2.2.x` to support the `dev-setup` flag, which allows
> development dependencies to be packaged, making it very practical to install
> locally all the elements needed to create a pleasant development environment.

When you have a suitable version of OPAM, you can run the following command to
build a [local switch](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-local-switches/) to
create a sandboxed environment (with a good version of OCaml, and all the
dependencies installed locally).

```shell
opam update
opam switch create . --deps-only --with-dev-setup --with-test --with-doc -y
eval $(opam env)
```

And that's all there is to it. Launching `dune build` should build the project!
At present, the project simply prints to standard output, but you can build your
project in `bin/`. YOCaml and its various plugins will be accessible in the
scope of this directory. The setup should work with Vim and Emacs (if they are
configured to work with OCaml) and with any editor configured to use LSP (Merlin
and OCaml-lsp-server being development dependencies of the project).

## Run the binary `ring.exe`

Just run the `ring.exe` binary compiled from `bin/ring.ml` like this:

```shell
dune exec bin/ring.exe
```

## Launching tests

The build procedure is based on `dune`, without any particular sorcery, so
issuing the following command is enough to run the tests:

```shell
dune test
```

For more information on [dune](https://dune.build/) testing, please go to the
[relevant manual page](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html).

## Project updates

When you have retrieved a new version of the project (from
[github.com/muhokama/ring](https://github.com/muhokama/ring) for example), you
can run the following command to make sure that all the dependencies are
present:

```shell
opam update
opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc --with-dev-setup -y
```

This is important because, for the moment, **ring** depends on a version of
YOCaml that is currently under development.

## Generating documentation locally

You can view the documentation for the entire project (and its dependencies)
locally by running the following command:

```shell
dune build @doc-new
```

The doc will be generated in the following directory:
`_build/default/_doc_new/html/docs/index.html` (with
[Sherlodoc](https://doc.sherlocode.com/) for easy search by type).
